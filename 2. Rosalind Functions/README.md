# Rosalind Bioinformatics Functions
These are solutions to bioinformatics practice questions based on the genome available through [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/locations/)

1. Computing Hamming Distance
Calculate the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols in two sequences of equal length differ.
2. Translating RNA into Protein
Convert an RNA sequence into a protein string using the standard genetic code.
3. Finding a Motif in DNA
Identify the starting positions of all occurrences of a motif (short DNA sequence) within a larger DNA string.
4.RNA Splicing
Simulate the process of RNA splicing by removing introns from a DNA sequence and translating the remaining exons into a protein.
5. Finding a Shared Motif
Determine the longest common subsequence shared between multiple DNA strings.
6. Finding a Spliced Motif
Identify whether a given DNA sequence appears as a subsequence in another DNA string.
7. Finding a Shared Spliced Motif
Locate a common subsequence shared across multiple DNA sequences, where the order matters but gaps are allowed.
8. Two Motifs, One Gene
Investigate the interactions between two distinct motifs within a single DNA sequence.
