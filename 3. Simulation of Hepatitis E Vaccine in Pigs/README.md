# Design and Simulation of a Veterinary Trial to Evaluate Hepatitis E Vaccine Efficacy in Pigs

This script simulates a veterinary trial to evaluate the efficacy of a Hepatitis E vaccine for pigs, aiming to determine the sample size 'N' needed to achieve 90% power at a significance level of Î±=0.05. It uses a permutation test to assess statistical significance by comparing infection rates in vaccinated (p(v)=0.1) and unvaccinated (p(c)=0.5) groups through repeated sampling and randomized reshuffling of data. The code calculates power for a range of sample sizes, identifies the smallest  N meeting the 90% threshold, and visualizes the results with a power curve.
