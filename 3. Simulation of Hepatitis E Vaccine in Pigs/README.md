# Design and Simulation of a Veterinary Trial to Evaluate a Vaccine Efficacy in a Model Organism Based Study

This script simulates a veterinary trial to evaluate the efficacy of a given vaccine for a model animal, aiming to determine the sample size 'N' needed to achieve a given threshold power at a significance level of Î±=0.05. It uses a permutation test to assess statistical significance by comparing infection rates in vaccinated (p(v)=0.1) and unvaccinated (p(c)=0.5) groups through repeated sampling and randomized reshuffling of data. The code calculates power for a range of sample sizes, identifies the smallest  N meeting the specified threshold, and visualizes the results with a power curve.


This project was developed with guidance from the Boston University BF550 Fall 2024 teaching team. Thank you to Dr. Ilijia Dukovsky, Yichi Zhang, and Junming Hu for your support and feedback.
