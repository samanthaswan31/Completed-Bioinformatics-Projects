# Design and Simulation of a Veterinary Trial to Evaluate a Vaccine Efficacy in a Model Organism Based Study

This project simulates and analyzes a hypothetical veterinary trial to evaluate the efficacy of a vaccination in reducing the probability of infection in a population of model organisms. The simulation uses statistical methods, including permutation testing and power analysis, to determine the minimum sample size required to detect a significant difference in infection probabilities between a vaccinated and control group.

The analysis is designed to answer the following key question:
What is the smallest number of model organisms 'N' required to achieve at least 80% power to detect a significant difference at an alpha level (Î±) of 0.05?

The simulation framework is entirely parameterized by:

x: Probability of infection in the control group

y: Probability of infection in the treatment (vaccinated) group

## Features

Sample Generation:

Randomly generates infection outcomes for control and treatment groups based on specified probabilities x and y.


Permutation Testing:

Uses a Fisher-style permutation test to evaluate the statistical significance of observed differences in mean infection rates between groups.


Power Analysis:

Iteratively calculates the power of the test for varying sample sizes 'N' to identify the smallest 'N' that meets the power threshold (80%).


Visualization:

Produces a power curve that visualizes the relationship between sample size and statistical power.


Parameter Flexibility:

Fully customizable inputs for control (x) and treatment (y) probabilities, allowing users to model a wide range of scenarios.
