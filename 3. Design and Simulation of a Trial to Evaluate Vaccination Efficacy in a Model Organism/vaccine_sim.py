# **Design and Simulation of a Trial to Evaluate Vaccination Efficacy in a Model Organism**
# 
# To test vaccination efficacy, it is useful to design trials using model organisms to test impacts. This program simulates one such trial using entirely undefined values for probabilities. The probability of becoming infected following an exposure is represented by the variable x for untreated individuals of the model organism. The developer of the vaccination believes that this probability is reduced to y following vaccination. The control and treatment groups have the same number of individuals, represented by N, and the statistical significance is evaluated using a permutation test. This program would allow the user to input the x and y probabilities and simulate trials to find the N to ensure approximately 80% power to detect a significant reduction in infection probability due to the vaccination at the Î± = 0.05 level.

Having run my simulation several times, I would choose an initial N value around 24 pigs.
