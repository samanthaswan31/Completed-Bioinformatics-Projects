# Neuronal Classifier Using iEEG Data to Predict Choice in a Gambling Task

This code processes iEEG-like data for 20 subjects, using PCA to reduce dimensionality and classify trials as "safe" or "not safe" based on Euclidean distance comparisons to mean trial representations. Classification accuracy is calculated by comparing predicted labels to true labels for each number of principal components. Final accuracy scores are stored and visualized, highlighting the relationship between PCA components and classification performance.
